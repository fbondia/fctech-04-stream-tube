## Project Overview

StreamTube is a video sharing platform under development. Through Phase 03, authenticated users can upload videos, and anyone with a link can watch a video after processing completes. Video management and publication are planned for Phase 04; social features are planned for later phases.

More info in the project overview: [docs/project-plan.md](docs/project-plan.md)

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo with two main areas:

- `nestjs-project/` — Backend API (NestJS 11, TypeScript, Express), video worker and Compose services. Implemented modules include auth, users, channels, mail and videos.
- `docs/` — Project documentation, architecture diagrams, and planning.
- `next-frontend/` — Next.js frontend for the earlier phases; phase 03 has no video UI.

## Architecture (C4 Container Diagram)

`docs/diagrams/software-arch.mermaid` is the target architecture and still contains future components. The implemented phase 03 containers are:

- **API** (NestJS) → auth, upload orchestration, durable processing intent, video metadata, streaming and download. It does not receive video bytes or publish BullMQ jobs.
- **Video worker** (NestJS + FFmpeg) → sole outbox dispatcher and BullMQ consumer; extracts media metadata, generates JPEG thumbnails and commits video state.
- **PostgreSQL 17** → users, channels, videos and processing outbox.
- **MinIO Community / S3** → private originals and thumbnails buckets.
- **Redis 7 + BullMQ** → persistent processing queue.
- **Mailpit** → local transactional email capture.

The video frontend remains outside phase 03. See `nestjs-project/README.md` for the implemented HTTP routes and verification commands.

## Docker Networking

This project runs entirely in Docker containers. When configuring connections between services (database, cache, queue, etc.), **always use the Docker Compose service name** as the host — never `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

Inside a container, `localhost` refers to the container itself, not the host machine or other containers. Services communicate through the Docker Compose network using their service names (e.g., `db`, `nestjs-api`).

- **Correct:** `DB_HOST=db` (the Compose service name)
- **Wrong:** `DB_HOST=localhost`

This applies to all environment variables, configuration files, and code that references service hosts.

## Working Principles

- **Single Responsibility:** each module, service, and function should have a clear, focused responsibility. Re-evaluate adherence at every step — when a module starts owning logic or entities that are not its own (e.g., a service creating an entity from another domain), extract it immediately into the proper module instead of deferring to a later corrective task.
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript usage across all layers.
- **Testing:** Strong emphasis on pyramid testing at all levels to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- **Code Quality:** Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style. Code reviews should focus on readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docs for architecture, setup, and troubleshooting in `docs/`.

## Definition of Done (Technical)

A change is only considered complete when **all** of the following pass:

1. The relevant test suite passes (unit + integration + e2e affected by the change).
2. The full test suite passes before finishing the task.
3. TypeScript compiles cleanly: `npx tsc --noEmit` exits with code 0. Compilation errors must never be left as debt for future tasks.
4. Lint passes: `npm run lint`.

If any of these fails, the task is not done — fix the underlying issue before declaring completion.


## Git Conventions

- **Main branch:** `main` — never commit directly to it
- Branches: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `docs/*`
- **Commits:** short, descriptive messages focused on the "why" of the change
- **Workflow:** Git Flow conventions. Two long-lived branches:
  - `main` — stable, production-ready code 
  - `dev` — integration branch; all feature/bugfix/hotfix branches start from `dev` and merge back into `dev`
  - When `dev` is stable, it is merged into `main`

## Testing Policy

Every change must be tested. During development, run only the tests related to the modified code. Before finishing, always run the full test suite to ensure nothing is broken.

## Scope Limits

- Work on **one feature, fix, or refactoring at a time** — do not mix scopes
- Do not include cosmetic changes (formatting, renaming) alongside functional changes
- If something out of scope comes up during work, note it as a separate task instead of acting on it
- Focus on the defined scope for each task to ensure clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
- If you identify a necessary change that is out of scope, create a new issue or task for it instead of including it in the current work.

## Agent Skill Usage

When working on any task (planning, implementing, debugging, refactoring, 
reviewing, etc.), decompose the request into its underlying subtasks and 
concerns, then identify which available skills match any of them and activate 
those skills.

## Library Documentation Lookup

Before using a new library, check its installed version and official documentation. Use Context7 when it is available in the active session; otherwise consult the official documentation directly and record the source in the phase library references.

Always:

- Check the installed library version in the project manifest
- Retrieve version-compatible documentation
- Cross-reference APIs to avoid deprecated or incompatible patterns
- Follow the official documentation over training data

Skip documentation lookup only for trivial operations such as:

- Variable declarations
- Basic control flow
- Simple CRUD using established project patterns

If a library is involved and there is uncertainty, documentation lookup is mandatory.
If the documentation returned does not match the installed version, flag the discrepancy before proceeding.
